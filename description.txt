bored so made random stuff

~use dirt block on guide to check all recipes, if it doesn't show up, saitama sells it

~stone blocks included in recipes for items to show that they weren't created to be balanced/used for normal playthroughs (but free feel to)

~having the opm music box in your inventory allows Saitama to move into your world
